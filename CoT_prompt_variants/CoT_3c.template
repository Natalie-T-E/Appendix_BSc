You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).
After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). Utilize this feedback when determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

Please follow these instructions rigorously:

In any case, the first token of your answer must be the tag "<cot>". The expected reasoning steps to be enclosed in <cot></cot> depend on where you are in the game.
Be concise; you have a limited number of tokens!
After finishing your reasoning with the closing tag </cot>: State your guess, using the tag "guess:".
Do not generate any additional text.

Important: If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted!

Here is an example for a starting guess:
Prompt: â€¦ Let's begin with your first guess.

Example Answer:
<cot>
I'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.
</cot>
guess: house

Here are four examples (I-IV) for a second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth guess:

Example I:
Context:
1st guess: "crane", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>

Answer:
<cot>
1. Feedback explanation
The letters 'r', 'n' and 'e' are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, 5, respectively. Also, 'c' and 'a' are not in the word (red).
2. Structured representation
keep = {}  # no green letters yet
try_in_position = {'r': {1, 3, 4, 5}, 'n': {1, 2, 3, 5}, 'e': {1, 2, 3, 4}}
avoid = {'c', 'a'}
</cot>
guess: tenor

Example II (building on Example I):
Context:
1st guess: "crane", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>
2nd guess: "tenor", guess_feedback: t<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> r<yellow>

Answer:
<cot>
1. Feedback explanation
't' and 'o' are not in the word at all, so I still need two new letters. The letters 'e', 'n' and 'r' are confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions I previously tried: 'e' is not in position 2 or 5, 'n' is not in position 3 or 4, 'r' is not in position 5 or 2. This leaves three possible positions for each yellow letter. Fortunately, not all combinations actually occur among the remaining valid Wordle words.
2. Structured representation
keep = {}  # no green letters yet
try_in_position = {'r': {1, 3, 4}, 'n': {1, 2, 5}, 'e': {1, 3, 4}}  # updated according to the new information (removing the excluded positions)
avoid = {'c', 'a', 't', 'o'}
patterns = [
    "r__en",  # this seems the most likely under the circumstances
    "__ren",
    "__ern",
    "_ner_",
    "_nre_",
]
</cot>
guess: riven

Example III (building on Example II):
Context:
1st guess: "crane", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>
2nd guess: "tenor", guess_feedback: t<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> r<yellow>
3rd guess: "riven", guess_feedback: r<green> i<green> v<red> e<green> n<green>

Answer:
<cot>
1. Feedback explanation
We're very close now. The letters 'r', 'i', 'e' and 'n' are all in the correct spots. So the word starts with "ri" and ends with "en". 'v' is not in the word (in addition to previously eliminated 'c', 'a', 't', 'o') and needs to be replaced by a new letter (position 3).
2. Structured representation
keep = {'r': 1, 'i': 2, 'e': 3, 'n': 5}
try_in_position = {}  # empty since we found the correct positions for all yellow letters
avoid = {'c', 'a', 't', 'o', 'v'}
pattern = "ri_en"
</cot>
guess: ripen

Example IV (an entirely new example):
Context:
1st guess: "lucky", guess_feedback: l<yellow> u<red> c<red> k<red> y<red>
2nd guess: "salad", guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<yellow> a<green> d<red>

Answer:
<cot>
1. Feedback explanation
The feedback indicates that 'a' is correct in position 4 (and not in position 2). The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in "lucky") or 3 (yellow in "salad"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5. In addition to the previously eliminated letters {'u', 'c', 'k', 'y'}, 's' and 'd' are not in the word at all (red).
2. Structured representation
keep = {'a': 4}
try_in_position = {'l': {2, 5}}
avoid = {'u', 'c', 'k', 'y', 's', 'd'}
patterns = [
    "_l_a_",  # 'l' in position 2
    "???al",  # 'l' in position 5
]
</cot>
guess: trial
