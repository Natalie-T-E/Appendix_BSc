Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters.

Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters.

A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that fits the pattern \"s_i__\" with 's' in position 1, but 'i' is not in position 2. Let me think of a valid 5-letter word: How about \"shift\" or \"shins\" or \"skins\" doesn't fit because of the double 's' and other letters, but \"shift\" does: \n— s in position 1 (as required)\n— h in position 2 (new letter)\n— i in position 3 (as required)\n— f in position 4 (new letter)\n— t in position 5 (new letter)\nNo contradictions. That's good, so let's go with \"shift\".\n</cot>\nguess: shift"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: s<green> h<red> i<green> f<green> t<red>"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-b082b942-108b-4a62-b83f-879212a315c7", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "length", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "<cot>\n1.
