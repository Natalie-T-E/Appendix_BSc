You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). Utilize this feedback when determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nPlease follow these instructions rigorously:\n\nIn any case, the first token of your answer must be the tag \"<cot>\". The demanded reasoning steps to be enclosed in <cot></cot> depend on where you are in the game.\n\nFor the starting guess:\nThere is only one step within <cot></cot>: Provide a short explanation for your guess.\nThen state your guess, using the tag \"guess:\".\n\nFor all subsequent guesses:\nPlease adhere to the following 2 reasoning steps within <cot></cot>:\n1) Explain the provided feedback. Be specific about both letters and positions (1-5). It can be helpful to mention relevant information from your earlier guess feedbacks as well.\n2) Find your next guess: a valid 5-letter word in accordance with the identified constraints. Important: Take your first idea that does not contradict any constraints. Do not forget the word length constraint. If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted! Be concise; you have a limited number of tokens! You must finish this step with the closing tag </cot>.\nThen state the guess you chose in step 2 once more, using the tag \"guess:\". Please do NOT come up with a new guess at this point.\n\nDo not generate any additional text.\n\n-----------\nHere is an example for a starting guess:\nPrompt: … Let's begin with your first guess.\n\nExample Answer:\n<cot>\nI'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.\n</cot>\nguess: house\n\n-----------\nHere are two examples for a second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth guess:\n\nExample I:\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe letters 'r', 'n' and 'e' are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, 5, respectively. Also, 'c' and 'a' are not in the word (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid 'c' and 'a' and introduce two new letters instead (for example, 's', 't', 'l', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'i' or 'y'). Also, I'm trying to find a new arrangement for the yellow letters 'r', 'n' and 'e'. Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters. All criteria are fulfilled, so \"tenor\" is a good next guess.\n</cot>\nguess: tenor\n\nExample II:\nContext:\n1st guess: \"lucky\", guess_feedback: l<yellow> u<red> c<red> k<red> y<red>\n2nd guess: \"salad\", guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<yellow> a<green> d<red>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe feedback indicates that 'a' is correct in position 4 (and not in position 2). The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5. In addition to the previously eliminated letters ('u', 'c', 'k', 'y'), 's' and 'd' are not in the word at all (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that fits the pattern \"_l_a_\" with 'l' in position 2, alternatively \"???al\", placing 'l' in position 5. \"???al\" seems like a good starting point. To fill in the placeholders, I need three new letters. Common consonants I haven't tried yet include: 't', 'r', 'n'. How about \"trial\" (T-R-I-A-L):\n— t in position 1 (new letter)\n— r in position 2 (new letter)\n— i in position 3 (new letter)\n— a in position 4 (as required)\n— l in position 5 (different from pos1 in \"lucky\" and pos3 in \"salad\", fitting the pattern \"???al\")\nNo contradictions.

A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid 'h', 'o', 'u', 's', 'f', 'a', and 'k' and introduce four new letters instead. Since 'l' and 'e' are yellow, I'll try to place them in different positions. A common word that comes to mind is \"blest\" or \"bleep\" or \"gleam\" but \"gleep\" is not a word and \"bleep\" has an 'a' and a 'p' is not necessary, \"gleam\" seems like a good starting point, placing 'l' and 'e' in positions that fit: \n— g in position 1 (new letter)\n— l in position 2 (different from pos2 in \"flake\")\n— e in position 3 or 4 or 5 (different from pos5 in \"house\" and \"flake\"), let's try position 4\n— a is eliminated, let's try \"gleam\" without the 'a', for example \"gleem\" (no), \"glees\" (no, 's' is eliminated), \"gleep\" (no, 'p' is not necessary and 'a' is not in the word), so let's try \"gleam\" without the last 'a' and with a different letter, for example \"gleem\" (no), how about \"glees\" without the 's' — \"glee\" (too short), let's add a letter, for example \"gleeb\" (no), \"gleef\" (no, 'f' is eliminated), \"gleeh\" (no, 'h' is eliminated), so let's try \"gleam\" with 'l' and 'e' and without 'a', for example \"glems\" (no, 's' is eliminated), so let's try \"gleem\" without the last 'm' — \"glee\" (too short), let's add a different letter instead of 'm', for example \"gleen\" or \"glees\" (no, 's' is eliminated), \"gleeb\" (no), \"gleef\" (no), so let's try \"gleen\".", "1. Feedback explanation\nThe letters 'g', and 'a' are not in the word (red), while 'l' and 'e' are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively (yellow), and 'n' is in the word and in position 5 (green).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid 'h', 'o', 'u', 's', 'f', 'k', 'g', and 'a' and introduce three new letters instead. Since 'l', 'e', and 'n' are in the word, I'll try to place 'l' and 'e' in different positions, and keep 'n' in position 5. A common word that comes to mind is \"lenes\" or \"lends\" or \"lents\" but \"lends\" seems like a good guess, however 'd' was not tried yet."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
