The letter 't' is in the word but not in position 4 (yellow). The letters 'w' and 'h' are not in the word (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that starts with 's', includes 'a' and 't' in different positions, and does not include 'w' or 'h'. A possible word is \"squat\": 's' is in position 1, 'a' is moved to position 4, and 't' is moved to position 5. 'q' and 'u' are new letters.\n</cot>\nguess: squat", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1748960908, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 2486, "total_tokens": 2659, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2432, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default"}}]
