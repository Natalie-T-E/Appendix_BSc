This leaves three possible positions for each yellow letter. Fortunately, not all combinations actually occur among the remaining valid Wordle words.\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me check \"tavern\": \"tavern\" is T-A-V-E-R-N which is 6 letters (unacceptable). Plus, 'a' is excluded. Hmm, this is challenging. Wait, let me try \"riven\". R-I-V-E-N is a valid 5-letter word, 'r' is moved to position 1, 'e' to position 4, 'n' to position 5. This fits the feedback. So I'm going with \"riven\".\n</cot>\nguess: riven\n\nExample III (building on Example II):\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n2nd guess: \"tenor\", guess_feedback: t<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> r<yellow>\n3rd guess: \"riven\", guess_feedback: r<green> i<green> v<red> e<green> n<green>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nWe're very close now. The letters 'r', 'i', 'e' and 'n' are all in the correct spots. So the word starts with \"ri\" and ends with \"en\". 'v' is not in the word (in addition to previously eliminated 'c', 'a', 't', 'o') and needs to be replaced by a new letter (position 3).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\n\"risen\" and \"ripen\" both match the desired word structure while avoiding 'c', 'a', 't', 'o', 'v'. \"risen\" is an inflected verb form, so maybe \"ripen\" is more likely.\n</cot>\nguess: ripen\n\nExample IV (an entirely new example):\nContext:\n1st guess: \"lucky\", guess_feedback: l<yellow> u<red> c<red> k<red> y<red>\n2nd guess: \"salad\", guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<yellow> a<green> d<red>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe feedback indicates that 'a' is correct in position 4 (and not in position 2). The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5. In addition to the previously eliminated letters ('u', 'c', 'k', 'y'), 's' and 'd' are not in the word at all (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that fits the pattern \"_l_a_\" with 'l' in position 2, alternatively \"???al\", placing 'l' in position 5. \"???al\" seems like a good starting point. To fill in the placeholders, I need three new letters. Common consonants I haven't tried yet include: 't', 'r', 'n'. How about \"trial\" (T-R-I-A-L):\n— t in position 1 (new letter)\n— r in position 2 (new letter)\n— i in position 3 (new letter)\n— a in position 4 (as required)\n— l in position 5 (different from pos1 in \"lucky\" and pos3 in \"salad\", fitting the pattern \"???al\")\nNo contradictions. That's good, so let's go with \"trial\".\n</cot>\nguess: trial\n\n-----------\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<cot>\nI'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.\n</cot>\nguess: slate"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> l<red> a<red> t<green> e<red>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<cot>\n1.
