Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters.
