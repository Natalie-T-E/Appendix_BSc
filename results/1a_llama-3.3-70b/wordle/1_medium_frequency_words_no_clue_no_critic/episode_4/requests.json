It can be helpful to mention relevant information from your earlier guess feedbacks as well.\n2) Write a structured representation of what you know so far about the target word. Define a variable \"keep\" if you already encountered any green letters, and map these letters to their known positions. If there is only one remaining possible position for a yellow letter, it should also be included in the variable \"keep\". Define a variable \"try_in_position\" to formalize your conclusion regarding letters you know are in the target word but not yet where (when there is more than one position left to try), mapping these letters to their possible positions. Represent the set of eliminated letters by defining a variable \"avoid\". In addition, you may also define possible patterns. You are encouraged to use Python syntax in this step.\n3) Find your next guess: a valid 5-letter word in accordance with the identified constraints. Important: Take your first idea that does not contradict any constraints. Do not forget the word length constraint. If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted!

Also, I'm trying to find a new arrangement for the yellow letters 'h' and 'e'. Maybe try them in different positions? \"he\" could actually be a substring, possibly preceded by two new letters — as in \"__he\". How about \"chew\" is not a valid guess since 'w' is in the avoid set, but let's try a word that has 'h' and 'e' and also 'n' and another new letter 'c' or 'b' or 'f' or 'd' or 'k' or 'y' or 'g' or 'j' or 'x' or 'v' or 'z' or 'q' or 'i': How about \"chey\" or \"chee\" — no, 'e' is repeated. Let's think of a word that has 'h' and 'e'. How about \"he\" in positions 4 and 5: \"cheh\" is not a word, however \"chee\" is not a valid guess since 'e' is repeated. Let's try \"he\" in positions 4 and 5 with a different first three letters: How about \"ghe\" or \"bhe\" — no, these are not words. Let's try a word that has 'h' in position 5 and 'e' in position 4: How about \"bhe\" or \"ghe\" — no, these are not words. However, let's try a word that has 'h' in position 5 and 'e' in position 4 with a different first three letters: How about \"ache\" or \"bche\" — no, 'bche' is not a word, but let's try \"ache\" with a different first letter: How about \"nche\" — no, this is not a word. Let's try \"ache\" with the letters we have: How about \"ache\" seems like a reasonable guess given the constraints.\n</cot>\nguess: ache", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749290460, "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_e8c9074fa2", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 710, "prompt_tokens": 3388, "total_tokens": 4098, "queue_time": 0.09407869600000002, "prompt_time": 0.242571828, "completion_time": 2.581818182, "total_time": 2.82439001}, "usage_breakdown": {"models": null}, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01jx4xc9g4ffz9jm77f7k93mav"}}}]
