A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid 'c' and 'a' and introduce two new letters instead (for example, 's', 't', 'l', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'i' or 'y').

Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters.

Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5.

Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5.
