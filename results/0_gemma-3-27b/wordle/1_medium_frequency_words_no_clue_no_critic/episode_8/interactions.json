You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). Utilize this feedback when determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"storm\" might be:\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> o<green> r<yellow> m<red>\n\nPlease follow these instructions rigorously:\n\nIn any case, the first token of your answer must be the tag \"<cot>\". Then explain how you are using the guess_feedback to arrive at a new guess. Let's think step by step. Your reasoning steps may depend on where you are in the game.\nBe concise; you have a limited number of tokens!\nAfter finishing your reasoning with the closing tag </cot>: State your guess, using the tag \"guess:\".\nDo not generate any additional text.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response must be formatted as follows:\n<cot>\nyour step-by-step reasoning\n</cot>\nguess: apple\n\nImportant: If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted!\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T09:36:43.977850", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<cot>\nI will start with a common word containing many vowels to maximize information gain.\n</cot>\nguess: adieu", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T09:36:43.977850", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = sniff\nguess = adieu\nguess_feedback = a<red> d<red> i<green> e<red> u<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T09:36:43.977850", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> d<red> i<green> e<red> u<red>", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T09:36:46.947985", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<cot>\nThe feedback indicates that 'i' is in the correct position.
