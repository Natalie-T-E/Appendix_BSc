You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). Utilize this feedback when determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nPlease follow these instructions rigorously:\n\nIn any case, the first token of your answer must be the tag \"<cot>\". The expected reasoning steps to be enclosed in <cot></cot> depend on where you are in the game.\nBe concise; you have a limited number of tokens!\nAfter finishing your reasoning with the closing tag </cot>: State your guess, using the tag \"guess:\".\nDo not generate any additional text.\n\nImportant: If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted!\n\n-----------\nHere is an example for a starting guess:\nPrompt: â€¦ Let's begin with your first guess.\n\nExample Answer:\n<cot>\nI'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.\n</cot>\nguess: house\n\n-----------\nHere are two examples for a second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth guess:\n\nExample I:\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1.

The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5.
