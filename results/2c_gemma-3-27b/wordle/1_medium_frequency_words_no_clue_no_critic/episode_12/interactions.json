You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). Utilize this feedback when determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nPlease follow these instructions rigorously:\n\nIn any case, the first token of your answer must be the tag \"<cot>\". The expected reasoning steps to be enclosed in <cot></cot> depend on where you are in the game.\nBe concise; you have a limited number of tokens!\nAfter finishing your reasoning with the closing tag </cot>: State your guess, using the tag \"guess:\".\nDo not generate any additional text.\n\nImportant: If your guess consists of more or less than five letters, the game will be aborted!\n\n-----------\nHere is an example for a starting guess:\nPrompt: … Let's begin with your first guess.\n\nExample Answer:\n<cot>\nI'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.\n</cot>\nguess: house\n\n-----------\nHere are four examples (I-IV) for a second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth guess:\n\nExample I:\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe letters 'r', 'n' and 'e' are in the word but not in positions 2, 4, 5, respectively. Also, 'c' and 'a' are not in the word (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid 'c' and 'a' and introduce two new letters instead (for example, 's', 't', 'l', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'i' or 'y'). Also, I'm trying to find a new arrangement for the yellow letters 'r', 'n' and 'e'. Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters. All criteria are fulfilled, so \"tenor\" is a good next guess.\n</cot>\nguess: tenor\n\nExample II (building on Example I):\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n2nd guess: \"tenor\", guess_feedback: t<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> r<yellow>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\n't' and 'o' are not in the word at all, so I still need two new letters. The letters 'e', 'n' and 'r' are confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions I previously tried: 'e' is not in position 2 or 5, 'n' is not in position 3 or 4, 'r' is not in position 5 or 2. This leaves three possible positions for each yellow letter. Fortunately, not all combinations actually occur among the remaining valid Wordle words.\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me check \"tavern\": \"tavern\" is T-A-V-E-R-N which is 6 letters (unacceptable). Plus, 'a' is excluded. Hmm, this is challenging. Wait, let me try \"riven\". R-I-V-E-N is a valid 5-letter word, 'r' is moved to position 1, 'e' to position 4, 'n' to position 5. This fits the feedback. So I'm going with \"riven\".\n</cot>\nguess: riven\n\nExample III (building on Example II):\nContext:\n1st guess: \"crane\", guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n2nd guess: \"tenor\", guess_feedback: t<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> r<yellow>\n3rd guess: \"riven\", guess_feedback: r<green> i<green> v<red> e<green> n<green>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nWe're very close now. The letters 'r', 'i', 'e' and 'n' are all in the correct spots. So the word starts with \"ri\" and ends with \"en\". 'v' is not in the word (in addition to previously eliminated 'c', 'a', 't', 'o') and needs to be replaced by a new letter (position 3).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\n\"risen\" and \"ripen\" both match the desired word structure while avoiding 'c', 'a', 't', 'o', 'v'. \"risen\" is an inflected verb form, so maybe \"ripen\" is more likely.\n</cot>\nguess: ripen\n\nExample IV (an entirely new example):\nContext:\n1st guess: \"lucky\", guess_feedback: l<yellow> u<red> c<red> k<red> y<red>\n2nd guess: \"salad\", guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<yellow> a<green> d<red>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe feedback indicates that 'a' is correct in position 4 (and not in position 2). The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5. In addition to the previously eliminated letters ('u', 'c', 'k', 'y'), 's' and 'd' are not in the word at all (red).\n2. A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that fits the pattern \"_l_a_\" with 'l' in position 2, alternatively \"???al\", placing 'l' in position 5. \"???al\" seems like a good starting point. To fill in the placeholders, I need three new letters. Common consonants I haven't tried yet include: 't', 'r', 'n'. How about \"trial\" (T-R-I-A-L):\n— t in position 1 (new letter)\n— r in position 2 (new letter)\n— i in position 3 (new letter)\n— a in position 4 (as required)\n— l in position 5 (different from pos1 in \"lucky\" and pos3 in \"salad\", fitting the pattern \"???al\")\nNo contradictions. That's good, so let's go with \"trial\".\n</cot>\nguess: trial\n\n-----------\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T11:03:21.545963", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<cot>\nI'm starting with a common five-letter English word, which includes frequent consonants and vowels.\n</cot>\nguess: house", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T11:03:21.545963", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = crone\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T11:03:21.545963", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T11:03:26.967799", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<cot>\n1.
