Let me check the constraints: 't' is in position 1 (as required), 'u' is now in position 2, which is in try_in_position['u'] (fine), 'l' is now in position 3, which is in try_in_position['l'] (fine), 'i' is an eliminated letter, so \"tulip\" is not suitable. Let's try \"tubal\": 't' is in position 1 (as required), 'u' is now in position 2, which is in try_in_position['u'] (fine), 'b' is a new letter, 'a' is now in position 4, which is in try_in_position['a'] (fine), 'l' is now in position 5, which is in try_in_position['l'] (fine). \"tubal\" doesn't include any eliminated letters. All criteria are fulfilled, so \"tubal\" is a good next guess.\n</cot>\nguess: tubal", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1748949160, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 2827, "total_tokens": 3267, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 2688, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default"}}]
