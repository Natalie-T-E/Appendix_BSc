Structured representation\nkeep = {'a': 3}\ntry_in_position = {'g': {1, 2, 4}}\navoid = {'s', 'l', 't', 'e', 'c', 'r', 'm', 'p', 'b', 'h', 'n'}\n3. A fitting 5-letter word\nI need to find a word with 'a' in position 3, 'g' in one of the positions {1, 2, 4}, and avoid the letters {'s', 'l', 't', 'e', 'c', 'r', 'm', 'p', 'b', 'h', 'n'}. Let's try \"guava\":\n— g in position 1 (fits try_in_position)\n— u in position 2 (new letter)\n— a in position 3 (as required)\n— v in position 4 (new letter)\n— a in position 5 (new letter)\nNo contradictions. That's good, so let's go with \"guava\".\n</cot>\nguess: guava", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1748949019, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 1681, "total_tokens": 1963, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1536, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default"}}]
