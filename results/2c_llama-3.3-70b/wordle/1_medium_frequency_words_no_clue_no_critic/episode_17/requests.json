Also, I'm trying to find a new arrangement for the yellow letters 'r', 'n' and 'e'. Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed different from position 5 in \"crane\" (fine), 'n' was incorrect in position 4 and is moved to position 3 (fine), 'r' was incorrect in position 2 and is now in position 5 (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters.

Feedback explanation\n't' and 'o' are not in the word at all, so I still need two new letters. The letters 'e', 'n' and 'r' are confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions I previously tried: 'e' is not in position 2 or 5, 'n' is not in position 3 or 4, 'r' is not in position 5 or 2.

R-I-V-E-N is a valid 5-letter word, 'r' is moved to position 1, 'e' to position 4, 'n' to position 5. This fits the feedback.

The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5.

A possible combination could be a word that has 'u' and 's' in different positions, such as \"_us_\" or \"_su_\". Let me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints.

Alternatively, \"lungs\" or \"stuns\" could work, but they also include letters that might not fit. Another option is \"slung\" or \"sungu\" (no, \"sungu\" is not valid), so let's try \"slung\" or \"stuns\" without the letters that don't fit, such as \"lunch\" (no, includes 'h' which is eliminated), \"bunks\" (no, includes 'b' and 'k' which haven't been tried yet, but let's keep it simple), \"sunks\" (no, includes 'k' which hasn't been tried yet), \"dunks\" (no, includes 'd' which hasn't been tried yet).
