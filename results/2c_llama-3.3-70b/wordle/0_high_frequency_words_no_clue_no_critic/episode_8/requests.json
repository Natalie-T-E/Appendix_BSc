The letters 's', 'p', and 'd' are not in the word. Since 'e' is green in position 3 and yellow in position 2, I'll try to find a word that keeps the 'e' in the third position and introduces new letters. A possible word could be one that maintains the 'e' in the third position and has a different letter in the second position, such as \"cease\" but 's' and 'a' are red, however \"creep\" has a 'p' which is red. Another option could be \"bleep\" and \"blees\" but they are not valid or have letters that are red, however \"glees\" and \"gleep\" have a 'g' and a 'p' or 's' which are red. Let's consider \"free\" and add two letters, one at the beginning and one at the end.\n</cot>\nguess: freed"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> r<yellow> e<yellow> e<green> d<red>"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-7de35464-b1b9-4336-8e72-2a8cd0d426a3", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "<cot>\nThe feedback indicates that the 'e' in the third position is still correct, and the 'e' in the fourth position is also correct.
