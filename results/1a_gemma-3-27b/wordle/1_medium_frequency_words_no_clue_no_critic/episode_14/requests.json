A fitting 5-letter word\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that fits all our constraints: So I need to avoid {'c', 'a'} and introduce two new letters instead (for example, 's', 't', 'l', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'i' or 'y'). Also, I'm trying to find a new arrangement for the yellow letters 'r', 'n' and 'e'. Maybe try them in reverse order? \"en\" could actually be a substring, possibly followed by a new letter and then by 'r' — as in \"_en_r\" (alternatively, \"en_r_\"). \"tenor\" comes to mind. Let me check the constraints: 'e' is now placed in position 2, which is indeed in try_in_position['e'] (fine), 'n' is moved to position 3, which is in try_in_position['n'] (fine), 'r' is now in position 5, which is in try_in_position['r'] (fine). \"tenor\" doesn't include any eliminated letters. All criteria are fulfilled, so \"tenor\" is a good next guess.\n</cot>\nguess: tenor\n\nExample II:\nContext:\n1st guess: \"lucky\", guess_feedback: l<yellow> u<red> c<red> k<red> y<red>\n2nd guess: \"salad\", guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<yellow> a<green> d<red>\n\nAnswer:\n<cot>\n1. Feedback explanation\nThe feedback indicates that 'a' is correct in position 4 (and not in position 2). The letter 'l' is present but not in position 1 (yellow in \"lucky\") or 3 (yellow in \"salad\"). Moreover, position 4 is ruled out implicitly via the green 'a', this means 'l' must be in position 2 or 5. In addition to the previously eliminated letters {'u', 'c', 'k', 'y'}, 's' and 'd' are not in the word at all (red).\n2. Structured representation\nkeep = {'a': 4}\ntry_in_position = {'l': {2, 5}}\navoid = {'u', 'c', 'k', 'y', 's', 'd'}\npatterns = [\n    \"_l_a_\",  # 'l' in position 2\n    \"???al\",  # 'l' in position 5\n]\n3. A fitting 5-letter word\n\"???al\" (patterns[1]) seems like a good starting point. To fill in the placeholders, I need three new letters. Common consonants I haven't tried yet include: 't', 'r', 'n'. How about \"trial\" (T-R-I-A-L):\n— t in position 1 (new letter)\n— r in position 2 (new letter)\n— i in position 3 (new letter)\n— a in position 4 (as required)\n— l in position 5 (different from pos1 in \"lucky\" and pos3 in \"salad\", fitting the pattern \"???al\")\nNo contradictions.
