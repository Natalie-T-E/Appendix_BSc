A fitting 5-letter word\nI need a word that includes 'r', 'e', and 'p' in positions other than 2, 3, and 4, and avoids the letters 'c', 'n', 'd', 'y', 's', 'l', 'a', 't', and the second 'e'. Let's try placing 'r' in position 1, 'e' in position 4, and 'p' in position 2. I can use other common letters like 'i' and 'o'. The word \"peril\" fits these criteria:\n— p in position 1 (different from position 4 in \"crepe\")\n— e in position 2 (different from position 3 in \"crepe\")\n— r in position 3 (different from position 2 in \"crepe\")\n— i in position 4 (new letter)\n— l in position 5 (new letter)\nNo contradictions.
