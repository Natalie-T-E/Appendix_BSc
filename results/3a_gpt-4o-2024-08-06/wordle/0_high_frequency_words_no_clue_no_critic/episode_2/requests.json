Define a variable \"keep\" if you already encountered any green letters, and map these letters to their known positions. If there is only one remaining possible position for a yellow letter, it should also be included in the variable \"keep\". Define a variable \"try_in_position\" to formalize your conclusion regarding letters you know are in the target word but not yet where (when there is more than one position left to try), mapping these letters to their possible positions. Represent the set of eliminated letters by defining a variable \"avoid\". In addition, you may also define possible patterns. You are encouraged to use Python syntax in this step.
