You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:01.939221", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:01.940602", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = koala\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:01.940602", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.306305", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"o\" is in the correct position, so I'll keep it and try to build around it with new letters, focusing on common combinations and word patterns that include the letter \"o\" in the middle.\nguess: coach", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.307416", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = koala\nguess = coach\nguess_feedback = c<red> o<green> a<green> c<red> h<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.307416", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> o<green> a<green> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.690897", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"o\" and \"a\" now in the correct positions, my next guess will try to utilize these letters while introducing new ones that are commonly found together in English words, aiming to fill in the remaining blanks.\nguess: loads", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.690897", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = koala\nguess = loads\nguess_feedback = l<yellow> o<green> a<green> d<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:02.690897", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<yellow> o<green> a<green> d<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:03.161868", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The presence of \"l\" as a yellow letter suggests it's in the word but not in the right position, and with \"o\" and \"a\" already correctly placed, my next guess will attempt to find a suitable position for \"l\" while replacing the incorrect letters with new possibilities.\nguess: loafy", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:03.162857", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: llama-3.3-70b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:37:03.162857", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
