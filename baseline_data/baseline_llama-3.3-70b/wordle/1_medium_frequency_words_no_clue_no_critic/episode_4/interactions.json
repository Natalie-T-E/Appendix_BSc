You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:49.027748", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:49.027748", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = bench\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:49.028750", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:49.469904", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"h\" and \"e\" are present in the word but not in the correct positions, while \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" are not in the word.
