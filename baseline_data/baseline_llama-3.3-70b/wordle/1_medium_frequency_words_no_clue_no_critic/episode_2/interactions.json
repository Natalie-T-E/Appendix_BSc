You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.514725", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.514725", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = loyal\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.514725", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.906928", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"o\" is in the correct position, so I'll keep it and try to build around it with new letters, focusing on common combinations and word patterns that include the letter \"o\" in the middle.\nguess: coach", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.906928", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = loyal\nguess = coach\nguess_feedback = c<red> o<green> a<yellow> c<red> h<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:43.906928", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> o<green> a<yellow> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.376632", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"o\" still in the correct position and \"a\" being in the word but not in the right spot, my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different combinations, looking for words that have \"o\" and \"a\" together, and exploring various consonants to accompany them.\nguess: boats", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.376632", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = loyal\nguess = boats\nguess_feedback = b<red> o<green> a<yellow> t<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.376632", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> o<green> a<yellow> t<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.784592", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The presence of \"o\" in the correct position and \"a\" in the word suggests I should continue to build around these, trying different placements for \"a\" and introducing new consonants that are commonly paired with \"o\" and \"a\" in English words.\nguess: loads", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.784592", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 4\ntarget_word = loyal\nguess = loads\nguess_feedback = l<green> o<green> a<yellow> d<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:44.785667", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<green> o<green> a<yellow> d<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:45.251508", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With both \"l\" and \"o\" now in the correct positions, and \"a\" still in the word but not quite right, my next guess will focus on finding the right spot for \"a\" and introducing new letters that fit well with \"l\" and \"o\", considering common word patterns and endings.\nguess: loafy", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:45.252506", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: llama-3.3-70b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-06-07T15:36:45.252506", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
